## About

I am an undergraduate student at VIT Chennai and currently an **Intern at Samsung Research and Development**.  
My work and learning focus on understanding real-world systems, writing maintainable code, and contributing thoughtfully to collaborative environments.

I am strongly drawn to open-source software because it values long-term thinking, community learning, and responsibility toward shared codebases. I enjoy reading existing implementations, understanding design decisions, and improving systems incrementally.

## Experience

**Intern — Samsung Research and Development**

- Exposure to industry-scale development practices  
- Learning how research ideas translate into production-quality systems  
- Emphasis on code quality, collaboration, and documentation  
- Understanding how large teams maintain and evolve complex software  

This experience has reinforced my interest in building reliable, well-designed systems and contributing to projects that outlive short-term goals.

## Why Open Source

Open source represents:
- Community-driven learning  
- Mentorship through review and discussion  
- Thoughtful engineering over quick results  
- Software built for long-term impact  

I am motivated to grow as a contributor who understands both the technical and human aspects of collaborative development.
