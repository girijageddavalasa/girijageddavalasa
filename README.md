## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at VIT Chennai with a strong inclination toward open-source software development.  
I enjoy contributing to projects that create real-world impact and believe in learning through collaboration, code reviews, and community-driven development.

My interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Cybersecurity.  
I actively explore repositories, study large codebases, and improve my skills by contributing, experimenting, and building.

Open source is not just about code for me — it is about community, consistency, and long-term growth.
