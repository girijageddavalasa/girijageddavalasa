## About

I am an undergraduate student at VIT Chennai who genuinely enjoys working with open-source software.  
I am drawn to open source because it encourages thoughtful collaboration, long-term learning, and meaningful impact.

Rather than focusing on short-term metrics, I care about understanding systems, reading existing code, improving clarity, and contributing in ways that help projects grow sustainably.

## Why Open Source

Open source represents:
- Shared learning instead of isolated work  
- Mentorship through reviews and discussions  
- Responsibility toward users and maintainers  
- Code that lives beyond a single project or semester  

I am especially interested in contributing to projects where design decisions matter and community values are respected.

- I prefer readable, maintainable solutions  
- I value feedback and code reviews  
- I document and explain decisions clearly  
- I aim to improve small parts of a system thoughtfully

## Current Direction

I am exploring projects related to:
- Developer tools and infrastructure  
- AI-assisted systems  
- Security-aware applications  
- Documentation and usability improvements  

I am open to guidance, mentorship, and long-term collaboration.
